manually created infra
=====================
time
errors
if something goes wrong, tracking is very difficult
restoring the infra is time taking..
version control

Infra as a code
==================
version control --> versioning of our code, review, history of infra, collobaration
CRUD --> operations on infra is easy creating, updating, reading and deleting
consistent infra -> IaaC can setup same infra across all environments, basically working in DEV not working in PROD
inventory management --> we can check IaaC to understand what are the services we are using
cost --> switch off the infra in non business hours, switch on again in business hours... we can schedule to stop the servers at 8PM start again at 8AM
dependency management --> IaaC can understand the dependencies between resources..
Modules --> we can extend terraform code using modules

terraform init --> 

HCL --> Hashicorp configuration language

{
	key = value
}

everything is called as resource

resource "type-of-resource" "name-you-provide" {

	ami_id = 
	name = 
	sg_id =
	instance_type =
	subnet_id = 
}
